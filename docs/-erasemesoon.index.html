    ### Mission
Create an open-ai style chat library suitable for the PHP to mostly reusable in their own applications, including a well-refined UI.

We will emphasize the following
* Understandable Code
    * Self-documented code
    * Orientation document(s) that explain how the code fits together
* Learning Opportunities
    * Emphasizing educating other developers on how come up-to-speed on ai and this package
* Flexible Deployment
    * Lots of examples of how to customize for your own use-cases (tweaking the UI, turning off features, etc.)
    * Compatability with Laravel and Symfony
    * Good test cases and development cases
    * Production-ready-flags (like, removing some development-only features)


### Motivation
This started as an offshoot of making a chat-like WebApp for interacting with AIs in the business-education space. After getting some proof-of-concept going, I found the edge-details around implementing streaming and reactive UI was starting to get tricky, leading to a potential re-architecting of the app. This was going to stretch my own knowledge, but it also could become an opportunity for me to better engage the community, and even give back a bit.

### PHP Evangelization
Python & REACT get most of the love out in the real-world. Showing nicely-refined UI with LLMs is a nice way to for PHP to properly reclaim its appropriate glory. More importantly, we believe a core value of PHP has been its supportive community and well-documented projects - this is an opportunity to continue this.

### Personal Backstory
I've developed php on-and-off since 2002-ish. Most of my projects have been fairly private, so this is my attempt to engage more publically.
